      <h2>My name is Paula Shin and I am passionate about human centered design.</h2>

    <div class = "about-text">
      <p>I enjoy working on interesting problems to deliver the most efficient, accessible, and visually appealing solutions. I have experience in user experience and graphic/visual design for industries like health insurance, entertainment events, and other promotional purposes.
        <br><br>
        I’ll be furthering my interest in user experience by pursuing a Master’s degree in Human Computer Interaction at Carnegie Mellon University - the premiere institute for HCI. I am also currently an Associate Product Designer at Health eCareers, working on various projects to support the Product Team.
        <br><br>
        When I am not designing, I am either weightlifting, listening to music, cooking, or finding new adventures here in Pittsburgh. </p>
