            I enjoy working on interesting problems to deliver the most 
            efficient, accessible, and visually appealing solutions. I have 
            experience in user experience and graphic/visual design for 
            industries like health insurance, entertainment events, and other 
            promotional purposes.
            <br>
            I am also furthering my interest in user experience by pursuing a 
            Master’s degree in Human Computer Interaction at 
            <a href="https://hcii.cmu.edu/academics/mhci">Carnegie Mellon University</a>
            - the premiere institute for HCI. I am also currently an Associate 
            Product Designer at Health eCareers, working on various projects to 
            support the Product Team.
            <br>
            When I am not designing, I am either weightlifting, listening to music, cooking, or finding new adventures here in Pittsburgh.

            My interest in UX design/research began when I spoke to a UX designer 
            friend who described the role as a combination of information organization, 
            psychology, and arts skills, in order to make a tech product easy, 
            accessible, and fun to use. Interested in learning more, I joined 
            Design Buddies, an online community created to bring designers 
            of all backgrounds and disciplines together. I was so intrigued 
            by the different facets of design and how it combined my passions 
            for learning about people's behaviors and empathizing with others, 
            through coming up with tangible solutions with digital design. 
            This encouraged me to join UXTerps, my university's organization 
            of students interested in user experience research and design.

            I have always been curious to learn the “why?” behind people’s actions, 
            and through my experiences with personal projects and design hackathons, 
            I've enjoyed speaking with people about their perspectives on the topic 
            at hand while working on interesting challenges. <br>
            I attended my first hackathon virtually in 2020 during the pandemic, 
            which is where I learned that design can be a powerful tool to and 
            combines 2 things I am known for: curiosity and creativity. <br> 

            I’m looking for a role that will allow me to solve interesting problems 
            help people strive towards a fulfilling life, by reaching their goals 
            faster and bringing joy to their everyday lives, within the health 
            & wellness space, financial technology, or the media and entertainment industry.
